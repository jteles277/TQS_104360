# Unit Testing 

Unit testing is when you (as a programmer) write test code to verify units of (production) code. A unit is a small, coherent subset of a much larger solution. A true “unit” should not depend on the
behavior of other (collaborating) modules.

### Unit tests help the developers to 
1. **Understand** the module contract (what to construct); 
2. **Document** the intended use of a component; 
3. **Prevent regression errors**; 
4. **Increase confidence** in the code.

**JUnit** and **TestNG** are popular frameworks for unit testing in Java.
